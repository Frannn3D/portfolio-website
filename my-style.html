                <p>Firstly I analysed the current market. I looked at competitors apps, checking what features they had in common but also what made each app different. I've analysed the flow of the user experience and what
                  function felt more useful to
                  me as a user. I then checked what kind of new innovative functions are being implemented in the retail sector through digital devices.
                  I ran into some interesting findings, like the usage of beacons to notify the user of a new upcoming event when walking near a shop. However, <span class="bold">there wasn't an app that would provide a good personalised
                    recommendation
                    section from the
                    first moment the user gets into the app.</span> </p>

              <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-5 space-left2-md space-left-lg">
                <p>I also realised how <span class="bold">clothing apps should not limited to online shopping, but could used to enhance the experience in shops too.</span><br>
                  As a UX designer, it seemed to me those apps were trying to push their products on the users, instead of understanding the user needs first. While I could understand how a number of shoppers might want to just follow the latest
                  fashion
                  trends, I also thought some might be more picky and therefore that could have been the audience for my app.</p>

                  The first one was gender related. During the registration process I could have asked to the users to enter their gender and let that set whether the following clothes images would have been for men or women. However, this approach
                  did
                  not feel very inclusive and people from the LGBTQ+ community could find it quite outdated. I was also wondering how could I make my app appealing to gender fluid people too. I did some research, but it seemed websites and apps have
                  the
                  clothes divided by men, women, and perhaps girls and boys. Therefore I decided I would have only one main section and include images of many different styles, from feminine ones, to boyish and neutral ones.</p>

                  showing both men and women wearing different types of clothes in the same screen, users might mistakenly think there is a problem with the app. Therefore I added the classic sections: man, woman, girl and boy. I have however paid

              <p>The project went quite well. If I had the opportunity to work on a similar project again, I think I would approach a few things differently. I would interview a few people early on to make sure my assumptions are correct and I would try to gather feedback on my wireframes through a face-to-face interview or a video call. While different people appreciated the features I have implemented in my app, I think it would be better to gather some data early on and have that guiding the project.</p>

              <h2 class="max-w300-md">Possible future implementations</h2>
              <p>In a second iteration, I would push further the app abilities to enhance the user shopping experience. The app could provide notifications when the user is nearby shopping and there is some new item that follows the custom style established. Perhaps this feature could set to be activated during a certain time range, like weekends only, so it would not bother the user in the morning while commuting.</p>
