            <strong>Book Pop</strong> is a concept app that was firstly created
            during one of the <em>Adobe Creative Jams</em>, in 7 days. Me and
            another CareerFoundry student collaborated on its creation, pushing
            it further after the creative jam ended. Book Pop is aimed at
            parents that wants to swap children books, allowing them to create
            and join events in a Covid-safe environment.

                    liked how the books were shown as a list and we analysed the
                    information displayed for books and events.

                      We decided the app should use

                      <strong>some nice illustrations</strong> inside it, so
                      parents and children would use the app together to look at
                      the books available at the different events.

                      We thought the app main will have a system for joining and
                      creating events and possibly a section were the child can
                      check out all the books available and like some. This
                      section would have a character to guide the child through
                      the app.

                    From our wireframes emerged
                    <strong>two different approaches for showing the events</strong>, one using a map and the other using a list. The map would
                    allow the user to immediately spot events nearby, however
                    the list allows an easy comparison between the events,
                    viewing immediately details such as time and target age. We
                    decided it could be useful to have both of them and the user
                    could simply change from one to the other.

                      We decided the home screen would show the books available
                      at nearby future events. It seemed important to us to show
                      some books in the main screen since books are the topic of
                      the app. We also noticed similar apps were doing the same,
                      which encouraged us to move towards this direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>We found challenging creating the event screen, in particular showing all the info in a clean way and also keeping the "Join in" button always on screen and recognizable from the background.
                      One trick that aided us was making the participants and books section horizontally scrollable.</p>

                  The app allows users to find upcoming events. The user will
                  get asked when joining if they want to swap, donate or borrow
                  books.

          <h1>Further edits</h1>
        <p>
          After the creative jam, we made some further edits to the app. My teammate made some <strong>testing</strong>: a survey and some usability testing. That way we wanted to see if people were actually interested in the app and what was working well.
          Some of the big changes we made were:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Removing the books on the home page</strong>, since the user found them confusing and did not understand those were books that you could find to nearby events.</li>
            <li><strong>Showing some upcoming events right from the home screen.</strong> Our reasoning was that other events apps also were showing those on the home page and also it felt the most useful to one, since it would display upcoming evnts nearby.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We got in touch with some volunteer developers and decided to change the project into a web
            app, since for them it would have been easier to make a web app rather than a native one.<br>
            The major changes that I have applied as I updated the screens are the <strong>addition of the footer</strong>
            to all the pages and the <strong>disappearance of the tab bar</strong>. I have also
            reduced the amount of features so we could launch with a Minimum
            Viable Product. We established it was essential to be able to create and join the events, but the feature of adding the books you would bring to the event was not so important for the moment.

          <p>
            Unfortunately this project wasn't eventually launched as a web app.
            However we learned a lot from it.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>It is important the project is created with a clear
                structure (like components and styles) from the start.</strong> During the
                creative jam, we started with a proper structure but eventually
                things got chaotic as the time was running out. Because of it, when
                we tried to further develop the project we had to spend much time on
                fixing components and similar.</li>
                <li>We should have tested the project idea further before
                  thinking of moving on toward the development. My design partner
                  found out about <strong>the importance of creating a smoke screen or a
                  concierge MVP</strong> that should be made before moving on with the
                  development phase. It was great to learn about it, even though it
                  meant we missed essential steps during our attempt to create this
                  product. </li>
                <li>
                  By working together on the same design file in
                  Adobe XD, <strong>we learned good practices in order to discuss any changes
                  and ideas effectively.</strong> One of our best ways to deal with this was to
                  create annotations around the artboards, each one of us using a
                  different colour for the text so it would be immediately
                  recognizable who was the author.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            To sum up, the project was a great learning experience and we
            managed to improve our understanding on collaborating with other
            people and of product development. Even though we did not launch it,
            we think when it will be the right time we might get back into it.
